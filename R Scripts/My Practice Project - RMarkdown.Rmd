## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

*Italic texts* requires an astrisk on each side of the words. 

(@) A number list needs the **@** symbol
(@) before each line

* An ordered list 
  + simply requires
  + a starting astrisk and **+** for each additional bullet
    - the "-" creates an indent?
* next bullet

## Quick Sequence
```{r}
x <- seq(1:15)
```
* This is a simple sequence
  + Look above for the level two header
